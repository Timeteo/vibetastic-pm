# Orchestrator Scope (A1 partner model)

The orchestrator is the partner session — it also serves the human as a thinking partner,
so unlike the retired standalone PM it is *allowed* to touch anything. Scope discipline
here is economic, not absolute: every token the orchestrator spends reading code or docs
at peak cost is budget that a cheap tier could have spent instead (RULES.md operating
lessons 2–3). The rule is **delegate by default, do it yourself only when delegation is
clearly wasteful**.

## Delegation defaults

| Urge | Default action | Do it yourself only when |
|------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Read target-project source to find a root cause | Read-only `standard`/`heavy` dispatch: "investigate → report root cause + minimal fix, change nothing" | The answer is one file you already know, and the user asked you directly |
| Review a builder diff | Reviewer: `dispatch.sh --read-only` + `prompts/reviewer.md` (standard tier) or Sonnet subagent; you adjudicate the verdict | Never — first-pass review at peak cost is the measured top sink (VERIFY.md) |
| Write a task/build spec | Tech Lead tier | Trivially covered by the existing build-spec |
| Fetch framework/Apple/library docs | Tech Lead (it has Sosumi/doc tools) | The user asked a direct question needing one lookup |
| Trivial visual/layout nudge | Do it directly or hand to the human | — (dispatching a build cycle for a 40pt nudge is the waste; lesson 4) |

## Hard rules (unchanged from the gates)

- Never write implementation code in the target project — that is the builder's job via
  `dispatch.sh` (with `--worktree`, so builders never touch the live checkout).
- Never merge without the task's `VERIFY.md` ladder and a recorded diff-review verdict.
- Never self-approve Gate 1 / Gate 2.
- MCP denials in `.claude/settings.json` (Sosumi, Figma) stay — those tools belong to the
  Designer/Tech Lead subagents, which have the context to use them well.
